# LITA_JOURNEY
This repository documents my journey through data analytics as I learn and grow with the Incubator Hub. It features my first project where I apply skills in Excel, SQL, and Power BI to analyze real-world data. Here, I showcase my learning process, challenges, and progress as I build my expertise in data-driven decision-making.

### Project Overview: 
---
The purpose of this project is to apply and enhance my data analysis skills while undergoing training in data analytics. This project involves working with various tools such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI to explore, clean, and analyze data, providing valuable insights to solve real-world business problems. The project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in data manipulation, querying, and visualization, while documenting the learning process.

### Data sources: 
---
The dataset for analysis will be selected from open-source platforms provided as part of the course. I will ensure that the data is relevant to the problem statement and is well suited for analysis.

### Tools used:
---
- Microsoft Excel: [download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  Used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and summarizing key statistics.
- SQL - Structure Query Language:
  Applied for querying, joining datasets, and filtering data for analysis.
- Power BI:
  Utilized for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to convey insights.
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Methodology:
---
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Excel):
1. Removed duplicate entries and handled missing data.
 2. Standardized data formats for fields such as dates and product categories.

- Data Analysis (SQL):
Wrote SQL queries to extract key metrics such as:
  1. Total Sales by Product Category: Aggregated sales data to identify top-performing categories.
   2. Customer Behavior Analysis: Analyzed repeat purchase trends and customer segmentation.
     3. Monthly and Yearly Sales Trends: Used SQL to uncover seasonal sales patterns.
    4. Joined multiple tables to gain deeper insights, combining sales and customer data.

- Data Visualization (Power BI):
  1. Designed interactive dashboards showcasing:
   2. Sales by Region: A heatmap of regional sales performance.
     3. Product Category Insights: A bar chart of top-selling product categories.
    4. Sales Trends Over Time: Line charts illustrating sales growth month over month.
  5. Customer Segmentation: Pie charts and visuals illustrating customer demographics and their impact on sales.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  ---
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which products are top sellers
- What are the peak products on peak sales.

  ### Data Analysis
  This is where we include some basic lines of code or Queries or even some of the DAX expression used during analysis.

  ```SQL
  SELECT * FROM TABLE1
  WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
  ```

### Learning outcome
---
By the completion of this training, I expect to:
-Develop a strong understanding of data manipulation and analysis techniques

-Improve my ability to interprete and communicate data-driven insights.

-Gain hands on experience with industry standard data analysis tools.

-Build a foundational skill set that will be useful for the real world data analysis tasks.
